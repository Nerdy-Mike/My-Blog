`git rebase` vs `git merge`

<aside>
ðŸ—½ Never use `git rebase`  is to never use it on public branches.

>_ The first thing to understand is that both solve the same problem, which is to integrate changes form one branch into another branch - they just do it in very different ways.

Consider what happens when you start working on a new feature in a dedicated branch, then another team member updates theÂ `main`Â branch with new commits. This results in a forked history, which should be familiar to anyone who has used Git as a collaboration tool.

Now, letâ€™s say that the new commits in `main` are relevant to the feature that you are working on. To get the new commits into your `feature` branch, you can either **merging** or **rebasing**.

## The Merge Option

The easiest option is to merge the main branch into the feature branch using something like:

```bash
git checkout feature
git merge main
```

>_ This creates a new â€˜merge commitâ€™ in the feature branch that ties together the histories of both branches, giving you a branch structure that looks like this:

Merging is nice because itâ€™s aÂ *non-destructive*Â operation. The existing branches are not changed in any way. This avoids all of the potential pitfalls of rebasing (discussed below).

On the other hand, this also means that theÂ `feature`Â branch will have an extraneous merge commit every time you need to incorporate upstream changes. IfÂ `main`Â is very active, this can pollute your feature branchâ€™s history quite a bit. While itâ€™s possible to mitigate this issue with advancedÂ `git log`Â options, it can make it hard for other developers to understand the history of the project.

# The Rebase Option

As an alternative to merging, you can rebase theÂ `feature`Â branch ontoÂ `main`Â branch using the following commands:

```bash
git checkout feature
git rebase main
```

This moves the entireÂ `feature`branch to begin on the tip of theÂ `main`Â branch, effectively incorporating all of the new commits inÂ `main`. But, instead of using a merge commit, rebasingÂ ***re-writes*** Â the project history by creating brand new commits for each commit in the original branch.

The major benefit of rebasing is that you get a much cleaner project history. First, it eliminates the unnecessary merge commits required byÂ `git merge`. Second, as you can see in the above diagram, rebasing also results in a perfectly linear project historyâ€”you can follow the tip ofÂ `feature`Â all the way to the beginning of the project without any forks. This makes it easier to navigate your project with commands likeÂ `git log`,Â `git bisect`, andÂ `gitk`.

But, there are two trade-offs for this pristine commit history: safety and traceability. If you donâ€™t follow theÂ [Golden Rule of Rebasing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing#the-golden-rule-of-rebasing), re-writing project history can be potentially catastrophic for your collaboration workflow. And, less importantly, rebasing loses the context provided by a merge commitâ€”you canâ€™t see when upstream changes were incorporated into the feature.

The rebase moves all of the commits inÂ `main`Â onto the tip ofÂ `feature`. The problem is that this only happened inÂ *your*Â repository. All of the other developers are still working with the originalÂ `main`. Since rebasing results in brand new commits, Git will think that yourÂ `main`Â branchâ€™s history has diverged from everybody elseâ€™s.

The only way to synchronize the twoÂ `main`Â branches is to merge them back together, resulting in an extra merge commitÂ *and*Â two sets of commits that contain the same changes (the original ones, and the ones from your rebased branch). Needless to say, this is a very confusing situation.
